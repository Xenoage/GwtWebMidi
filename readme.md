# GwtWebMidi

GwtWebMidi is a [free](license.md) [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org) binding to the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/).
It is still under development.

Currently, it is only supported in the Chrome browser, version 43 or higher.

Tip for testing GwtWebMidi in GWT development mode: Install Firefox 24. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1111920/multiple-firefox-versions-on-same-pc how to run multiple installations of Firefox in parallel. In Chrome, currently (2014-09-15) it does not work maybe.
